Hello I am Jack Klamer. I am a Staff Software Engineer at Starburst Data. I focus on distributed data systems and data modeling.

<p>I use this blog to make questionable technical decisions and feel incompetent about my AWS knowledge.
I also tend to have things that I need to go on about and have this site as a place to talk about them.</p>
<p>All opinions my own.</p>
